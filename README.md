Assignment 4.1: Event Driven Programming
Start Assignment
• Due Sunday by 11:59pm
 
• Points 100
 
• Submitting a website url or a file upload
COURSE OBJECTIVES:
• Demonstrate basic formal problem-solving techniques for programming.
• Describe and apply variables, basic and composite data types, and collections.  
• Develop basic and common algorithms using the elements of structured programming.
• Use loops and conditionals in a program.
• Create simple functions that accept parameters and return results.
• Demonstrate effective troubleshooting, testing, and debugging, of programs. 
JavaScript can make a webpage interactive in many ways. For this assignment, you are going to take the index.html page with meme image and make the image move around the screen using a Start button. The image should move until the Stop button is clicked.
Objectives
• Write code to create 2 buttons on the index.html page
	• Create button 1
	• Create button 2
• Code those buttons to trigger Events in JavaScript using functions
	• This function triggers event 1 the startbutton
	• This function triggers event 2 the stopbutton
• The Start button should call a function that moves the meme image around the index.html page
	• The function makes the image do something
• The Stop button should call a function that stops the meme image from moving around the index.html page
	• This function maeks the image stop doing something
• Apply Event Driven programming
• User Acceptance Test the Events


Use Event Driven Programming to 
            Create two buttons 




Requirements
• Write HTML code to create the Start button.
• Write HTML code to create the Stop button.
• Create a JavaScript function to enable/disable the Start button.
• This function should call another function that moves the meme image around the page.
• Create a JavaScript function to enable/disable the Stop button.
• This function should call another function that stops moving the meme image.
• Wire the Start button using the onClick to JavaScript Functions to disable the start button and Enable the opposite button clicked.
• Wire the Stop button using the onClick to JavaScript Functions to disable the stop button and Enable the opposite button clicked.
• Test the buttons.
• Have at least 1 creative element – images, fonts, background color, etc. 
• Create a nice look and feel for the user and make a great user experience!
• Comment above almost every line of your code, both HTML and JavaScript!
• Put a comment at the top of your HTML file with your name in it.
• Take one or more screen prints of your application running.
Deliverables
• Submit GitHub repo address.
• Submit a print screen of your application running.
